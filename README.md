# Sindhu Book Store
## Project Highlights
### Homepage Showcase
A bright, attractive grid layout displaying 20 books, each with clickable cover images and titles linking to detailed book pages.

### Book Detail Pages
Clean layouts where each book’s page features the cover on the left and a detailed description on the right — including author name and synopsis.

### Responsive Design
Flexible grid layout that adapts to all screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Mobile-friendly on narrower screens.

### Easy Navigation
Links from the homepage jump directly to the correct detailed section on the book page using anchor tags.

### Clean, Maintainable Code
No inline styling — all layout and color rules are managed separately in CSS for clarity and reusability.
